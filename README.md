## Roadmap
This project is intended to be a counter for "How many days since" the last mass shooting.

I also want to add a graph of all the mass shootings that have happened and the intervals of time between them
## Information

There is a lack of consensus on what constitutes a mass shooting, but most definitions include a minimum of three or four victims of gun violence, not including the shooter, in a short period of time. [More Info Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting?useskin=vector)
